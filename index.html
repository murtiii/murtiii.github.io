                    <p>We did a secondary round several years before our last company Streamlabs was sold. Back then, founder secondaries were not common. The only reason we got a chance to do it was because we had an acquisition offer on the table, and the VCs wanted us to not sell the company. That small liquidity-dose changed our personal lives, eased stress, increased risk tolerance and allowed us to go much further and longer with Streamlabs. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">We hope to give other founders this optionality. Selfishly, by buying assets that most investors don't, we also hope to generate superior returns over time.</p>

                    <p>You are the founder or early stage employee and your company is absolutely crushing it. And yet, life doesn't wait. You just got engaged, or want to start a family. Wouldn't it be nice to have some funds to buy a house? Whats the use of being a millionare on paper if you have to wait 10 years to see the first dollar? We can help. Consider selling us a small part of your equity. You still keep almost all the upside and get some cash now to get on with life. </p>
